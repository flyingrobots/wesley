# S.E.O.: Synergistic Enhancement Orchestrator

> **"Not just another platform; it's a paradigm shift in professional engagement!"**

We leverage cross-discipline synergies to disrupt traditional workflows, empowering you to upcycle your personal bandwidth through holistic monitoring and enhancement.

## üéØ Design Overview

S.E.O. is a **comprehensive workplace collaboration and monitoring platform** that demonstrates Wesley's ability to generate complex, multi-tenant applications with sophisticated surveillance capabilities, real-time features, and enterprise-grade security.

**Think:** The most dystopian corporate productivity app ever conceived - "What if LinkedIn, Microsoft Viva, and Black Mirror had a baby?"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

S.E.O. serves as the **ultimate Wesley showcase** because it exercises every Supabase feature while being technically challenging enough to prove Wesley's production readiness:

### Core Principles
1. **Schema-First Development** - Single GraphQL schema generates entire stack
2. **RPC-Heavy Architecture** - All business logic secured behind database functions
3. **Multi-Tenant Surveillance** - Complex RLS policies for department/team isolation
4. **Real-Time Everything** - Live bandwidth tracking, engagement monitoring, forced pairing
5. **Evidence-Based Productivity** - Every interaction logged, analyzed, and scored

### Technical Complexity Showcase
- **30+ interconnected tables** with complex relationships
- **Real-time aggregations** across multiple surveillance metrics
- **AI-driven scoring algorithms** hidden behind RPC functions
- **Multi-level security policies** based on role and surveillance level
- **High-frequency event processing** for activity monitoring
- **Edge function integrations** for facial analysis and engagement scoring

## üé≠ The Five Dystopian Modules

### 1. üìä Bandwidth Timeline
*"Your productivity, visualized in real-time!"*

**The Feature:** Public dashboard showing every employee's "bandwidth" score calculated from keystrokes, mouse movements, and engagement metrics. When your score drops below 41.3%, the system automatically pairs you with a high-performer for "coaching."

**Wesley Benefits:**
- Complex event sourcing with `ActivityEvent` partitioned tables
- Real-time aggregations and triggers for bandwidth calculation
- RPC functions for secure scoring algorithms
- RLS policies for different visibility levels

### 2. üçΩÔ∏è On My Plate
*"Visual task management with accountability!"*

**The Feature:** Tasks are displayed as different sized "plates" - from appetizers to Thanksgiving feasts. You can "offload" tasks to colleagues, but every delegation is broadcast company-wide with public justification required.

**Wesley Benefits:**
- Many-to-many relationships through `DelegationEvent` junction tables
- Real-time notifications and public broadcasting
- Audit trails for every task movement
- Complex constraint validation

### 3. üí¨ Synergistic Touchpoints  
*"Chat, but with engagement scoring!"*

**The Feature:** Workplace chat with mandatory buzzword templates. If your engagement score drops below 50%, you're locked out of messaging. Spend too much time chatting and your score also suffers.

**Wesley Benefits:**
- Message threading and complex chat relationships
- Real-time engagement calculation
- Permission-based messaging restrictions
- Sentiment analysis and buzzword tracking

### 4. üé® Ideation Decks
*"Creativity through mandatory compliance!"*

**The Feature:** Collaborative whiteboard that forces you to fill out forms with mandatory fields like "Leveraging," "Operationalizing," and "Scalability" before your idea can be shared with the company's "Thought Leadership" feed.

**Wesley Benefits:**
- Canvas/whiteboard real-time collaboration
- Form validation with business logic
- Auto-publishing to company feeds
- Creativity inhibition scoring algorithms

### 5. üé• Deep Dive Sessions
*"Meetings with facial surveillance!"*

**The Feature:** Video meetings where your camera must stay on, engagement is calculated from eye contact and facial expressions, and helpful pop-ups appear if your score drops: "It looks like you're losing focus. Let's take this offline and circle back when your bandwidth frees up!"

**Wesley Benefits:**
- Real-time video analytics integration
- Alert systems with configurable thresholds  
- Meeting participation tracking
- Behavioral pattern analysis

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Database Schema Highlights
```graphql
# Multi-tenant surveillance with complex scoring
type Employee @table @rls(enable: true) @realtime {
  current_bandwidth: BandwidthScore!
  engagement_level: EngagementLevel!
  surveillance_level: Int! @check(expr: "surveillance_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5")
  productivity_pattern: JSON  # AI-analyzed behavioral patterns
}

# High-frequency activity logging with partitioning
type ActivityEvent @table @realtime @partitioned(by: "created_at") {
  raw_data: JSON!  # Keystroke patterns, mouse movements, etc.
  productivity_impact: Float!  # Calculated impact score
}

# Real-time collaboration with ephemeral cursor tracking
type LiveCursor @table @realtime @ephemeral {
  status: CursorStatus!  # IDLE, MOVING, CONFUSED, RAGE_CLICKING
  last_update: DateTime! @default(value: "now()")
}
```

### RPC Function Architecture
All business logic secured behind database functions:
- `calculateBandwidthScore()` - Proprietary scoring algorithm
- `triggerForcedPairing()` - Automatic mentor assignment
- `validateBuzzwordCompliance()` - Creativity compliance scoring
- `recordFacialEngagement()` - Meeting surveillance data

### Real-Time Features
- Live bandwidth score updates across the organization
- Instant delegation broadcasts with public notifications
- Real-time cursor tracking in ideation canvases
- Live meeting engagement alerts and interventions

## üì± UX Design Philosophy

**Design Goal:** Maximum psychological pressure through gamification and public accountability.

### Visual Language
- **Corporate Minimal** - Clean, sterile interface that feels "professional"
- **Surveillance Friendly** - UI elements that normalize constant monitoring
- **Gamified Shame** - Progress bars, scores, and public leaderboards everywhere
- **Helpful Condescension** - "Friendly" AI suggestions that are actually controlling

### Key UX Patterns
1. **Always-Visible Metrics** - Your bandwidth score is always in the top-right corner
2. **Public Dashboards** - Everyone can see everyone else's productivity metrics  
3. **Forced Interactions** - System-mandated pairing and collaboration
4. **Buzzword Autocomplete** - Forms that guide you toward corporate speak
5. **Surveillance Normalization** - Camera feeds and engagement metrics feel "normal"
