## üö® ALPHA BLOCKERS (Fix First - Critical Issues)

### ‚úÖ 1. Fix Array Item Nullability Tracking
**Problem**: Only tracking field nullability, missing difference between `[T]!` vs `[T!]!`
- [x] Add `itemNonNull` flag to `unwrapType()`
- [x] Thread `itemNonNull` through `Field` and all generators
- [x] Generate correct `NOT NULL` + array element checks
- [x] Update Zod schema generation
- [x] Update migration diff logic

```javascript
// Implementation shape:
return { base, list, nonNull /* field */, itemNonNull };
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Remove Silent Type Coercion
**Problem**: Unknown types silently fallback to `String`, hiding schema bugs
- [x] Replace fallback with validation error
- [x] Add red "evidence" breadcrumb for unknown types
- [x] Throw explicit error instead of defaulting

### ‚úÖ 3. Fix SQL Generation Gating
**Problem**: `enableRLS` incorrectly gates entire DDL generation
- [x] Introduce `generateSQL` flag (default: true)
- [x] Keep `enableRLS` only for RLS policy emission
- [x] Update Orchestrator constructor
- [x] Test both flags independently

### ‚úÖ 4. Implement PostgreSQL AST ‚Üí SQL Conversion
**Problem**: `toSQL()` returns placeholder text
- [x] Add deterministic stringifier for SQL AST (already implemented)
- [x] Wire @supabase/pg-parser deparse
- [x] Ensure real SQL output now
- [x] Create flip-able backend for future updates

### Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] Instead of tests string comparing generated SQL, parse the SQL AST and inspect it (probably affects like vast majority of tests I expect)
- [ ] General audit of tests, ditch crap tests that use excessive mocks and spies/look for stdout/stderr strings
- [ ] Audit looking for god classes
- [ ] Audit looking for SRP violations
- [ ] Audit looking for `opts = {}` anti-pattern
- [ ] Code review looking at patterns used and opportunities to improve code quality
- [ ] Audit enforcing 1 class = 1 file policy
- [ ] Audit for JSDoc

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION FIXES

### ‚¨ú RPC Function Generator - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: Code exists but not integrated with parser/generator pipeline

#### Critical Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Fix GraphQL Directive Parsing**: Update GraphQLAdapter to recognize @rpc, @function, @grant directives
- [ ] **Wire RPC Generator**: Connect RPCFunctionGeneratorV2 to generate command pipeline  
- [ ] **Directive Registration**: Add RPC directive definitions to canonicalDirectives set
- [ ] **Operation Extraction**: Parse Query/Mutation fields and extract @rpc/@function logic
- [ ] **SQL Function Generation**: Convert @function(logic: "...") to CREATE FUNCTION statements
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Create E2E tests for mutations ‚Üí PostgreSQL functions

#### Parser Fixes Needed
- [ ] Add `@rpc`, `@function`, `@grant` to GraphQLAdapter.canonicalDirectives
- [ ] Handle string literal directive arguments (e.g., `@function(logic: "...")`)  
- [ ] Extract GraphQL operations (Query/Mutation fields) not just table types
- [ ] Pass operation metadata to RPC generator

#### Current Working State
- [ ] Pull table/column names from domain Schema
- [ ] Use `Field.isVirtual()` and related methods
- [ ] Stop inferring from `createX` naming

### ‚¨ú Test Generation Depth
- [ ] Use `getWeight()` to gate test complexity
- [ ] High-weight fields: uniqueness + nullability + default + RLS tests
- [ ] Low-weight fields: just structure tests

### 2025-09-03 - Complex RLS Testing & RPC Investigation

#### Complex RLS Capabilities Verified ‚úÖ
- **Multi-Tenant Surveillance Schema**: Created freaky-rls-schema.graphql with 9 interconnected tables
- **Complex Authorization Logic**: Successfully generated RLS policies with:
  - Multi-table JOINs in policies (department_members, organization_admins)
  - Hierarchical permissions (self ‚Üí manager ‚Üí org admin ‚Üí service role)
  - Surveillance level escalation (high surveillance employees visible to coworkers)
  - Time-based policies (90-day retention, activity windows)
  - Field-level update restrictions using `current_setting('rls.updating_field')`
  - Service role system operations with proper isolation
- **Generated 50+ RLS Policies**: All syntactically correct PostgreSQL with proper USING/WITH CHECK clauses
- **Production-Ready Output**: Complex policies like surveillance-triggered visibility and coaching pair management

#### RPC Function Status Investigation ‚ùå
- **Discovery**: RPC function generation is NOT fully implemented
- **Issue**: GraphQL parser doesn't recognize `@rpc`, `@function`, `@grant` directive syntax
- **Current State**: 
  - RPC generators exist in codebase (RPCFunctionGenerator, RPCFunctionGeneratorV2)
  - Example schemas with RPC directives fail to parse
  - Directive definitions cause "Syntax Error: Expected Name, found String" 
- **Gap Analysis**:
  - RLS generation: FULLY WORKING ‚úÖ
  - Table/DDL generation: FULLY WORKING ‚úÖ  
  - Model generation: FULLY WORKING ‚úÖ
  - RPC functions: ASPIRATIONAL CODE ‚ùå

#### Parser RLS Directive Fix ‚úÖ
- **Fixed**: GraphQLSchemaParser missing RLS directive extraction
- **Root Cause**: `convertTableDirectivesToExpectedFormat()` only handled `@table` and `@tenant` directives
- **Solution**: Added RLS directive mapping from `wes_rls`/`rls` ‚Üí `@rls` format expected by PostgreSQLGenerator
- **Result**: Complex RLS policies now generate correctly with `--supabase` flag
