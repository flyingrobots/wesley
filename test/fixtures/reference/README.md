# Reference Schema Fixture

A comprehensive GraphQL SDL that exercises most Wesley directives. Useful for:

- Ad hoc experimentation (manual `wesley generate` runs)
- Parser/regression tests when you need a fully-populated schema
- Comparing directive coverage with the curated examples in `../examples`

This schema is not wired into CI by default but serves as a handy foundation for new fixtures or docs examples.
