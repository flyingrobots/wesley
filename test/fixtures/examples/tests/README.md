# QIR Test Snapshots

Generated pgTAP/SQL outputs produced by the QIR `--ops` pipeline.

- `ops.pgtap.sql` â€“ Smoke assertions for emitted operations. Used by future pgTAP suites and reference documentation.

Regenerate intentionally if the DSL changes; update tests and docs alongside the snapshot.
