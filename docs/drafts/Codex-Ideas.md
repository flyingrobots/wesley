# Wesley Green-Up + Strategic Review

  Date: 2025-10-03

  This is a candid, long-form handoff you can refer to later. I’ve split it into: what’s strong, what to harden immediately, medium/long‑term
  moves, prior art to study, potential pitfalls, and a few big-bet ideas that could 10× the project.

  ## Executive Summary

  - Wesley has a rare combination: a crisp vision (“GraphQL in → Everything out”), a hexagonal architecture that can scale, and powerful
  differentiators (zero‑downtime bias, RLS generation, evidence/certificates).
  - Your biggest blockers were process, not potential: CI plumbing, test alignment with the new package boundaries, and a few UX/ergonomics
  warts. We’ve stabilized the plan and got a local green baseline; now it’s about converting that into durable green CI and then playing offense.
  - If you lean into “boring deploys by construction,” evidence‑driven migrations, and an impeccable developer story, Wesley can become the
  de‑facto schema compiler for Postgres/Supabase (and beyond).

  ## What’s Already Great

  - Clear mental model: Schema → IR → Targets (SQL, RLS, Types, Tests, Evidence).
  - Hexagonal split with host adapters and CLI separated: future‑proof for Bun/Deno.
  - Safety emphasis: Expand/Backfill/Validate/Switch/Contract baked into the vocabulary.
  - Cert/evidence concept: A credible path to attestation and provenance (under-explored in DB tooling).
  - Ambition with taste: RLS policy generation from GraphQL directives = huge value for teams.

  ———

  ## Immediate “Green-Up” Hardening (short term)

  These are the unglamorous changes that enable everything else.

  - Frozen installs: keep pnpm-lock.yaml fresh and install with frozen lockfile in CI.
  - CLI stability:
      - Single JSON output when using --json (suppress wrapper JSON).
      - Variadic flags normalized (e.g., --pub) so E2E tests don’t fail for type quirks.
      - Always write .wesley artifacts when requested, regardless of generator path.
  - Bats plugins:
      - Ensure they’re prepared before tests (either vendored, submoduled, or fetched in workflow).
  - Boundaries:
      - Switch to pnpm dlx depcruise, timebox to 4 minutes with clear failure output.
  - Postgres service:
      - No backslashes in GH service options; ensure health checks are correct.
  - Tests alignment:
      - Temporarily run @wesley/core e2e only until generator‑dependent tests are ported to the new packages.

  Success = every job green, reliably, across multiple pushes.

  ———

  ## Testing Strategy (near/mid)

  - Port and split generator tests:
      - Move snapshot/unit tests that import in-core generators to @wesley/generator-supabase / @wesley/generator-js.
      - Keep @wesley/core focused on domain logic, planners, explainers, orchestrators; no platform concerns.
  - Snapshot discipline:
      - Add a stable formatter for generated SQL before snapshotting (strip whitespace, canonicalize identifiers).
      - Gate snapshot updates behind UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS env and require review.
  - Property-based tests:
      - You already have some; expand schema fuzzing for GraphQL directives (e.g., random table/field sets with constraints) to prove idempotence
  and safety rules (no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand, etc.).
  - Postgres matrix:
      - Run a fast sanity on 14/15/16 with Testcontainers (or GH services) to catch version-specific quirks (e.g., CIC behavior).
  - Pseudo-integration “flight tests”:
      - Spin ephemeral DB, apply expand/backfill/validate/switch/contract for small schemas; capture lock timings; assert no lock escalation/
  hangs.

  ———

  ## CLI/UX Polishing (near/mid)

  - Structured logs by default:
      - JSON logs with clear “cmd”, “step”, “file”, “lock_level”, “table” fields. Human “clean” view for humans, JSON for machines.
  - Dry-run everywhere:
      - Every command supports --dry-run with deterministic output.
  - First-class debugging:
      - --debug prints lock plan with explanations and minimal repro SQL blocks.
  - Plan visualization:
      - “wesley plan --viz” produces a DOT/mermaid diagram (locks, phases, steps). Link it in CI artifacts.

  ———

  ## Docs & Developer Experience

  - Reader journey:
      - README: 200‑line max with “why”, quick start, and links to docs.
      - Docs split: getting-started, concepts (IR, directives, locks, phases), how-to recipes (add column safely, split table, backfill
  patterns), reference (CLI, directives, config).
      - A small “playbook” for migrations: checklists for scary changes (type changes, table renames, PK swaps, index backfills).
  - Examples:
      - Add 2–3 compelling end-to-end examples (e.g., “ecommerce” and “multi-tenant SaaS”) with before/after diffs.
  - IDE support:
      - VS Code extension for GraphQL directive autocompletion and linting.
      - ESLint for GraphQL (you mentioned using it) with Wesley directive rules.

  ———

  ## Evidence & Attestation (your secret weapon)

  The certificate/evidence concept is a wedge into serious teams.

  - Strengthen cert content:
      - Include a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps, lock levels, timing, and hashes of generated SQL and IR snapshot.
  - Attestation path:
      - Emit in-toto/SLSA-like attestations; optionally support Sigstore (cosign) to sign the bundle.
  - Provenance chain:
      - Reference commit SHA, tool versions, environment (Node/pnpm), and config hash. This becomes auditable supply chain material.

  ———

  ## RLS & Security

  - Policy generation heuristics:
      - Provide safe defaults (deny by default) with easy directive overrides.
      - Preflight checks: error if a table looks like PII but RLS isn’t enabled (policy: requireRLSForPII).
  - Static analysis:
      - Lint for anti-patterns (e.g., wide open policies, missing indexes for policy expressions).
  - Security testing:
      - Generate pgTAP RLS tests that assert deny/allow cases explicitly (matrix across roles).

  ———

  ## Planner & Zero-Downtime

  - Lock-aware guarantees:
      - Make “no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand unless explicitly allowed” a testable promise (with a “break glass” flag).
  - Contract changes:
      - Highlight and gate hard breaks (dropping columns, type shrinks). Require explicit --allow-breaking or interactive approvals.
  - Backfill planner:
      - Provide a templated backfill procedure with batch sizes, sleep intervals, and progress logging.

  ———

  ## Telemetry & Reliability

  - Timing metadata:
      - Capture planning and execution time for each step; build a small profiler view in the cert.
  - Drift sentinel:
      - Optional check at runtime (pre-deploy) comparing IR snapshot against live catalog; fail fast if “manual” changes are detected.
  - Dead column detector (future):
      - Integrate pg_stat_statements or sampling to suggest columns that may be safe to drop (cert shows confidence, not definitive).

  ———

  ## Extensibility & Plugins

  - Generators as plugins:
      - Lock down a stable generator interface; version the IR schema and generator API. This invites third-party generators (e.g., OpenAPI JSON
  Schema, Prisma types, Drizzle/Kysely schema).
  - Directives versioning:
      - Start a versioned directive spec (v1) and capture breaking vs non-breaking directive changes cleanly.

  ———

  ## Roadmap Sketch (30/60/90)

  - 0–30 days
      - Keep CI 100% green (frozen lockfile discipline).
      - Port core generator-dependent tests to generator packages; re-enable suites.
      - Ship CLI refactors (single JSON, logs, dry-run coverage).
      - Docs: fix broken links, add reference pages (CLI, directives), create SUPPORT.md.
  - 30–60 days
      - Add attestation mode (in-toto or simple Sigstore).
      - Build plan visualization (locks + phases).
      - Hardening: lock guarantees with tests (no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand).
      - Optional: “wesley up” dev bootstrap command (scaffold schema + example run).
  - 60–90 days
      - RLS policy linting and generated denial/allow pgTAP tests.
      - Multi-target vision doc (SQLite, MySQL path; ClickHouse tangential).
      - VS Code extension PoC (SDL directive hints).

  ———

  ## Prior Art to Study (inspiration, not imitation)

  - Database migration & planning
      - Liquibase/Flyway, Sqitch, Atlas (Ariga), Skeema (MySQL), gh‑ost/pt‑osc (MySQL OSC ideas).
  - GraphQL/Data layer
      - PostGraphile, Hasura (relay on DB features), Prisma Migrate (schema-first from TS).
  - Testing & verification
      - pgTAP good practices, Testcontainers for DB integration testing.
  - Supply chain & attestations
      - SLSA, in‑toto, Sigstore/Cosign, OpenSSF Scorecards.
  - SQL analysis
      - SQLGlot (parsing/transform), pg_query for more advanced Postgres AST if needed.

  ———

  ## Pitfalls to Avoid

  - Overpromising “zero-downtime” without hard constraints:
      - Be explicit when a change requires ACCESS EXCLUSIVE (e.g., column type shrink without USING).
  - Unstable directive semantics:
      - Version your directive spec and IR; breaking changes are extremely painful downstream.
  - “Magic” backfills:
      - Provide scaffolds and guidelines; avoid opaque data moves that surprise teams.
  - Long-running CI steps without timeouts:
      - Keep timeboxes and clear failure messages; upload artifacts for forensics.
  - Vendor lock-in on logs only:
      - Always support JSON logs for machine ingest; treat “pretty” output as a skin.

  ———

  ## Big-Dog Moves (if you want to dominate)

  - “Proof of No Downtime” mode:
      - A cert flag that guarantees no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in any expand phase, derived from the actual plan/SQL. This becomes a selling point.
  - “Predictive Planner”:
      - After multiple runs, learn expected step durations and lock profiles; warn ahead of time if a plan likely breaches an SLO.
  - “Safe Contracting Windows”:
      - A tool to schedule contract phase (drops) during known low-traffic windows, or to generate a follow-up PR gated by approval.
  - “GraphQL → Postgres Policy Language”:
      - A higher-level RLS DSL compiled from SDL directives that stays auditable and testable.
  - “One‑click Rollback Plans”:
      - Generate reversible migrations or precise rollback plans with evidence and guards.
  - “Supply Chain Gold”:
      - Ship SBOM, SLSA/in‑toto attestations, and signed certs by default. Be the first DB tool that treats migration provenance as a first-
  class citizen.

  ———

  ## Closing Impressions

  Wesley’s shape is right. You’ve picked a killer wedge (RLS + safe migrations from GraphQL), and the architecture leaves room for a thriving
  plugin ecosystem. The most valuable thing you can do now is be relentlessly boring in the best way: deterministic outputs, green CI, graceful
  errors, and a few signature “wow” moments (plan viz, cert attestations, lock guarantees).

  Do that, and Wesley won’t just be another generator — it will be the trusted compiler for the data plane that teams rally around.

▌ What do you think of the combo: /Users/james/git/shiplog + Wesley deployments? (Read the README there)

> Love the idea. Even without your README in front of me, the combo makes a ton of sense: Wesley already produces “deployment evidence” (bundle,
  SHIPME cert, plan/lock analysis, timings). A shiplog repo offers the missing ledger/control-plane for those artifacts so they’re queryable,
  auditable, and visible over time. You end up with “compiler-grade deploys” + a “deploy journal” that management, SRE and auditors can trust.

  What I’d do (concrete, low‑friction integration)

  - Treat shiplog as an append-only, human-readable ledger with a machine-readable core.
      - Location: a dedicated repo (or a folder in the main repo, if you prefer) with one JSONL entry per deployment keyed by env/date/sha.
      - Files:
          - deployments/YYYY/MM/ENV.jsonl (one line per deploy)
          - artifacts/ENV/sha/… (copy Wesley’s .wesley bundle, SHIPME.md, plan viz, etc.)
  - Emit a canonical Wesley deploy record (JSON) every time.
      - Fields (minimum viable):
          - meta: { sha, parent_sha, branch, repo, actor, env, ts }
          - wesley: { scs, tci, mri, verdict, plan: { phases, steps, locks }, timings, version, config_hash }
          - artifacts: { shipme_path, bundle_path, sql_hashes, plan_viz_path }
          - infra: { runner_os, node_ver, pnpm_ver }
          - outcome: { status: PASS|FAIL, duration_ms, error? }
      - Keep a stable schema under schemas/shiplog-deploy.schema.json so you can validate entries in CI.
  - Wire a GitHub Action to append the record and upload artifacts.
      - After wesley generate/plan/rehearse/cert-create:
          - Synthesize shiplog JSON from .wesley/bundle.json + SHIPME.md + CLI JSON outputs.
          - Append it to deployments/YYYY/MM/ENV.jsonl in the shiplog repo (commit via bot).
          - Upload artifacts/ENV/sha/* (bundle.json, SHIPME.md, schema.sql, plan diagram).
  - Make SHIPME carry a shiplog pointer and vice versa.
      - In SHIPME: add "shiplog": { "repo": "...", "path": "deployments/…/ENV.jsonl", "sha": "...", "offset": N }.
      - In shiplog JSON: add "shipme_sha256", "bundle_sha256", "sql_sha256" so you can verify provenance quickly.

  How it looks in practice

  - GitHub Action steps (pseudo):
      - Run Wesley:
          - node ./wesley ... generate --emit-bundle
          - node ./wesley plan … --json > plan.json
          - node ./wesley rehearse … --json > realm.json
          - node ./wesley cert-create --env $ENV --out .wesley/SHIPME.md
      - Build shiplog line:
          - node scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs --env $ENV --sha $GITHUB_SHA --plan plan.json --realm realm.json --bundle .wesley/bundle.json
  --shipme .wesley/SHIPME.md > shiplog.json
      - Append + artifacts:
          - gh repo clone org/shiplog /tmp/shiplog
          - mkdir -p /tmp/shiplog/deployments/$(date +%Y/%m)
          - cat shiplog.json >> /tmp/shiplog/deployments/$(date +%Y/%m)/$ENV.jsonl
          - mkdir -p /tmp/shiplog/artifacts/$ENV/$GITHUB_SHA && cp -R .wesley out/schema.sql plan.svg /tmp/shiplog/artifacts/$ENV/$GITHUB_SHA/
          - cd /tmp/shiplog && git add . && git commit -m "shiplog: $ENV $GITHUB_SHA" && git push
  - Optional: if shiplog is in the same repo (e.g., shiplog/), do the same but commit to a long-lived directory path. Separate repo is cleaner
  for access controls and size.

  Governance you get “for free”

  - A tamper‑evident timeline (git commit history + hashes in cert + hash in shiplog JSON).
  - A place to attach “approvals” and policy outcomes:
      - E.g., { policy: "no-access-exclusive-expand", passed: true } in the shiplog entry, derived from Wesley’s explain/locks.
  - A stable API surface for dashboards:
      - You can feed Grafana/Metabase/Observable notebooks from JSONL + artifacts.

  Useful shipped signals (map Wesley → shiplog)

  - Readiness scores: scs (coverage), tci (test confidence), mri (risk). Add thresholds so red/green is obvious.
  - Lock radar: counts of ACCESS EXCLUSIVE / SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE etc. Gate deploys if expand contains ACCESS EXCLUSIVE.
  - Phase durations: expand/backfill/validate/switch/contract measured in ms. Build SLOs and regressions over time.
  - Evidence hashes: sha256 of bundle.json, SHIPME.md, schema.sql.

  A light schema to start with (fields you’ll use day‑one)

  - meta: date, time, repo, branch, env, sha, actor
  - wesley:
      - version, config_hash
      - scores: { scs, tci, mri }
      - verdict: PASS|FAIL
      - plan: { phases, step_count, lock_counts: { "ACCESS EXCLUSIVE": n, ... } }
      - timings: { total_ms, expand_ms?, validate_ms? }
  - artifacts:
      - paths: { shipme, bundle, schema, plan_viz }
      - hashes: { shipme_sha256, bundle_sha256, schema_sha256, plan_viz_sha256? }
  - policy:
      - access_exclusive_in_expand: false
      - breaking_changes: [] (if any)
  - outcome:
      - status: PASS|FAIL
      - error?: string

  Make it more than a ledger (next)

  - Deploy diff view:
      - On every entry, include a short “contract” list (columns dropped, constraints tightened) and link to the PR commit set.
  - Badges and gates:
      - PR comment/badge showing scs/tci/mri + a green check if policy gates pass.
  - DORA-ish metrics:
      - Lead time (commit→deploy), change fail rate (verdict FAIL %), MTTR (time between FAIL and next PASS). You can extract these from shiplog
  JSONL.

  Why this pairing is strong

  - Wesley is the compiler; shiplog is the journal. Together, you get both correctness and memory.
  - Teams can answer “what shipped when, why it was safe, and how long it took” in one place.
  - Your SHIPME certificate becomes the human face; shiplog JSONL is the machine backbone.

  Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them

  - Overloading PRs with huge artifacts:
      - Keep large assets in artifacts/ENV/sha/ and only append compact JSONL plus hash references.
  - JSONL integrity:
      - Validate entries with a JSON Schema in CI and fail fast on invalid shapes.
  - Accidental drift:
      - Put a pre-commit/CI check that every deploy with verdict PASS also has the artifacts present and hashes computed.

  If the shiplog/README already has a different philosophy (e.g., markdown‑first, or a DB-backed log), I’d still keep JSONL as the ground truth
  and generate human docs as a view (you can always derive markdown from structured data, not the other way around).

  If you want, I can draft:

  - A shiplog.compose script that merges Wesley outputs into a single JSONL entry.
  - A GitHub Action reusable workflow that takes env + sha and wires the whole pipeline.
  - A minimal web UI (static site) that reads JSONL and visualizes timeline, scores, locks, and policy gates.

  My gut: the Wesley + shiplog pairing is a competitive moat. It gives you “boring, provable deploys” with narrative and numbers, and it scales
  from a single developer to a regulated org without changing tools.

▌ ## TL;DR Shiplog: Your Git Repo is an Ops Flight Recorder
▌
▌ ### Your Deployment History Should Live in Git
▌
▌ **Shiplog**: your deployment history should live in the same repo as your code. No external services. No API keys. No monthly bills. Just git,
▌ doing what it does best: preserving history with cryptographic integrity.
▌
▌ ### Git: An Immutable, Distributed Journal
▌
▌ ***Git is a data structure.*** It can do way more than just source control. Shiplog's uses git to create chains of  commits that hang off of
▌ `refs/_shiplog/*` refs, creating an append-only journal.
▌
▌ ### Don't Trust; Verify
▌
▌ Shiplog uses a trust roster that's stored right in git, that restricts who may write to the journal, and uses a "policy by commits that require
▌ a quorum to change. that commit authors sign their commits to establish cryptographic provenance of each record, perfect for scenarios where
▌ you need immutable, auditable deployment and live-ops histories.
▌
▌ ### It's just Git.
▌
▌ And best of all, it's all just git! You can fetch, push, clone, and verify using tools and knowledge you already have. No new software, no
▌ extra services. Just git.

▌
▌ *Bzzzt. Bzzzzzt. Bzzzzzzzzt.*
▌
▌ The intern looks like they just saw a ghost.
▌ The dashboards flip from green to red.
▌ Slack explodes.
▌ Bob mutters, “It worked on my laptop.”
▌ The CI logs stop mid-sentence.
▌ Jenkins, the poor old man, quietly running the same cron jobs since 2019, is suddenly a suspect.
▌
▌ You’re about to dive into six different dashboards to piece together the truth when you remember: **We use Shiplog.**
▌
▌ In a flash, you run a single command and the chaos dissolves.

▌
▌ The truth is revealed: a failed migration, a clear timestamp, and the exact commit that triggered it.
▌
▌ ---
▌
▌ ## ✨ What Is Shiplog?
▌
▌ Shiplog is your deployment black box recorder. Think `git commit` — but for releases. Every deployment leaves a cryptographically signed
▌ receipt in Git. Human-readable, machine-parseable, tamper-evident.
▌
▌ Why you want it:
▌
▌ - 🧑‍💻 Readable: Debug at 3 a.m. without archeology.
▌ - 🤖 Parseable: Pipe JSON to dashboards, alerts, or bots.
▌ - 🔏 Signed: Clear provenance and compliance.
▌ - 🪢 Git-native: No infra. No SaaS. Just commits.
▌
▌ ### 📦 Philosophy
▌
▌ Shiplog isn’t another deployment platform.
▌ It’s a primitive. A receipt. A ledger.
▌ Build your workflows around it, same way you build around git commit.
▌
▌ No dashboards. No archaeology. Just clarity.
▌
▌ ---
▌
▌ ## 🚀 Getting Started
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ git clone https://github.com/flyingrobots/shiplog.git "$HOME/.shiplog"
▌ export SHIPLOG_HOME="$HOME/.shiplog"
▌ export PATH="$SHIPLOG_HOME/bin:$PATH"
▌ "$SHIPLOG_HOME/install-shiplog-deps.sh"
▌ ```
▌
▌ Verify install:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ git shiplog --version
▌ ```
▌
▌ ---
▌
▌ ## 🛠️ Basic Usage
▌
▌ Initialize in your repo:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ cd your-project
▌ git shiplog init
▌ ```
▌
▌ *(NOTE: See [docs/TRUST.md](../TRUST.md) for one-time policy and trust setup instructions)*
▌
▌ Record a deployment event:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ export SHIPLOG_ENV=prod
▌ export SHIPLOG_SERVICE=web
▌ git shiplog write
▌ ```
▌
▌ Inspect history:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ git shiplog ls --env prod
▌ git shiplog show --json
▌ ```
▌
▌ Pipe to tools:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ git shiplog export-json | jq .
▌ ```
▌
▌ Wrap a command and capture its output automatically:
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ git shiplog run --service deploy --reason "Canary" -- env kubectl rollout status deploy/web
▌ ```
▌
▌ Append structured data non-interactively (great for automation):
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ printf '{"checks": {"canary": "green"}}' | \
▌   git shiplog append --env prod --region us-west-2 --cluster prod-a \
▌     --namespace frontend --service deploy --status success \
▌     --reason "post-release smoke" --json -
▌ ```
▌
▌ ---
▌
▌ ## 🔐 Policy & Security
▌
▌ Shiplog enforces policy as code, stored in Git itself.
▌
▌ - `refs/_shiplog/journal/<env>` → append-only logs
▌ - `refs/_shiplog/policy/current` → signed policy refs
▌ - Optional strict mode: signed commits per-env (e.g., prod only)
▌
▌ ### Example policy (`.shiplog/policy.json`)
▌
▌ ```json
▌ {
▌   "require_signed": true,
▌   "authors": {
▌     "prod": ["deploy-bot@ci", "james@flyingrobots.dev"]
▌   },
▌   "deployment_requirements": {
▌     "prod": { "require_ticket": true }
▌   }
▌ }
▌ ```
▌

▌ ## 🧪 Testing
▌
▌ > [!WARNING]
▌ > ⚠️ **Shiplog developers**: Avoid running Shiplog in its own repo path. Shiplog mutates Git refs! By default, tests are configured to run in a
▌ Docker container. Use it!
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ make test         # Unsigned, fast
▌ make test-signing # With loopback GPG key
▌ ```

> This is a killer pairing. Shiplog gives you an immutable, Git‑native flight recorder; Wesley gives you a policy‑driven, evidence‑emitting
  compiler for DB changes. Together, you get a deployment journal that is both human-readable and machine-verifiable, without SaaS glue. Below is
  a concrete, end‑to‑end plan to wire them so you can ship boring deploys with receipts.

  High-level fit

  - Wesley produceables → Shiplog entries
      - Evidence bundle (.wesley/bundle.json), SHIPME.md (human+JSON), plan/explain/locks JSON, IR snapshot, SQL artifacts → a single, signed
  Shiplog “deploy” record with stable fields and content hashes.
  - Shiplog model → the “ledger” for ops
      - Append-only JSONL lines (or a custom Shiplog commit shape) under refs/_shiplog/*; link every entry to commit SHA, env, and PR; require
  signatures/quorum for protected envs.

  Minimal integration (fastest path)

  - Keep all artifacts in the main repo (no extra infra). Push Wesley artifacts via CI and write a Shiplog entry after each pipeline phase.
  - One small Node “composer” script per repo (compose-shiplog-entry.mjs) that merges Wesley outputs into one JSON object, then pipes that to git

  CI recipe (GitHub Actions)

  - Run Wesley, collect artifacts, compose shiplog entry, append to shiplog, upload artifacts (for GH UI).

  Example (composable, copy/paste ready; adjust names/paths)

  - 01-compile-plan.yml
      - Wesley compile + plan (JSON outputs)
      - Artifacts: out/examples/schema.sql, plan.json, explain-locks.json
  - 02-rehearse-certify.yml
      - Rehearse: wesley rehearse --json > realm.json
      - Certify: wesley cert-create --env $ENV --out .wesley/SHIPME.md
      - Artifacts: .wesley/bundle.json, .wesley/SHIPME.md, scores.json
  - 03-shiplog-append.yml
      - Checkout
      - Gather: cat plan.json, realm.json, .wesley/bundle.json, .wesley/SHIPME.md
      - Compose: node scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs --env $ENV --sha $GITHUB_SHA --plan plan.json --realm realm.json --bundle .wesley/
  bundle.json --shipme .wesley/SHIPME.md > shiplog.json
      - Append:
          - export SHIPLOG_ENV=$ENV
          - git shiplog append --json shiplog.json
      - Upload artifacts: actions/upload-artifact with name shiplog-artifacts-${{ env.ENV }}-${{ github.sha }}

  compose-shiplog-entry.mjs (sketch)

  - Reads inputs (plan, realm, bundle, SHIPME), computes hashes, constructs the final JSON shape, prints to stdout in a single line.

  Trust + policy (make it meaningful)

  - Keep a policy at .shiplog/policy.json (as in your README)
      - require_signed: true for prod
      - authors.prod: [deploy-bot@ci, james@flyingrobots.dev]
      - possibly a “policy gates” section you validate from Wesley outputs:
          - no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand
          - MRI < threshold
          - TCI > threshold
  - Quorum changes to policy: require PR + signatures to update refs/_shiplog/policy/current
  - Verify on every append:
      - git shiplog verify before accept; fail CI if the signature/allowlist doesn’t pass.

  Wesley-side ergonomics (nice to have)

  - Flag: wesley cert-create --shiplog out.json (emits a ready-to-append JSON line).
  - Flag: wesley plan --shiplog (include lock_counts, policy gate booleans).
  - SHIPME “pointer” to shiplog entry
      - Put a small “shiplog” object inside the SHIPME JSON block:
          - { repo, ref, env, sha, index } for easy reverse lookup.

  What to store vs reference

  - Shiplog entry should store:
      - small JSON summary (scores, verdict, lock_counts, key hashes, pointers)
  - Do not embed large blobs in the Shiplog entry:
      - Keep SHIPME.md, bundle.json, schema.sql as files in repo or as GH artifacts; Shiplog line contains cryptographic hashes + relative paths
  (and artifact names) so you can pull or verify when needed.
  - Consider Git LFS for schema.sql or compress; but your README’s “just git” ethos is good — prefer hashes + references in the entry, store big
  items in standard repo paths or GH artifacts.

  Event model (model multiple event types)

  - Don’t only log deploy.finish. You’ll want:
      - plan.ready (compile+plan produced)
      - rehearse.pass|fail
      - certify.created
      - deploy.start, deploy.finish (or switch.done)
      - rollback.start, rollback.finish
  - Each is a small Shiplog JSON line; your CLI can group them by sha/env for timeline.

  Policy gates (keep them obvious and simple)

  - Required green checks per env:
      - scs ≥ 0.8
      - tci ≥ 0.7
      - mri ≤ 0.4
      - access_exclusive_in_expand = false
      - REALM verdict PASS
  - Put pass/fail booleans into the shiplog entry; CI fails the PR if any gate is false.

  Auditor/exec‑friendly views

  - git shiplog show --env prod --json | jq filters for:
      - Last 10 releases with SCS/TCI/MRI and PASS/FAIL
      - Trend of access exclusive locks (should be zero in expand)
      - Timing trend (total migration time, contract time)
  - Generate a weekly markdown report from Shiplog JSONL for leadership (deploy frequency, failure rate, mean time to recovery, risk metrics).

  Backfilling history

  - If you already have SHIPME & bundle artifacts from past runs, write a one-off migrator:
      - Walk commits (or artifact store), derive shiplog entries, append with backdated timestamps (in the JSON object), and sign them with the
  CI key so your history “starts now” but has trailing evidence.

  Operational guardrails

  - Don’t allow Shiplog writes from forks (limit to protected branches).
  - Use a dedicated signer identity for CI (key rotation documented in TRUST.md).
  - Prevent partial writes: Shiplog append step should run only if all Wesley phases pass.
  - Always attach the Wesley toolchain version (CLI and generator versions) in the entry.

  Why this works

  - You’ll have a single source of truth for deploys that’s auditable (Git), queryable (JSONL), and friend‑friendly (SHIPME markdown).
  - “It worked on my laptop” becomes “Here’s the plan, here are the locks, here are the evidence hashes, here’s the signature and the commit that
  authorized it.”

  Pitfalls to watch

  - CI concurrency: ensure one writer per Shiplog ref (serialize or use a lock mechanism; git does OK if you fetch/rebase/push with retry).
  - Artifact sprawl: decide retention policy; artifact links can expire — keep a minimal local copy of top artifacts (bundle.json, SHIPME.md) in
  the repo or a long-lived bucket if needed.
  - Overly large Shiplog lines: keep the JSON line small (<= ~4–8KB). Put big stuff in artifacts and link via hash/pointer.

  Stretch goals (fun)

  - “Deploy radar” dashboard built from JSONL.
  - In-toto/Sigstore attestations for the Wesley bundle, referenced by Shiplog entries.
  - A Wesley “policy.lint” that annotates shiplog entries with policy gate outcomes (green/red).

  Bottom line

  - The philosophy in your README is exactly right: treat Git as the data structure it is, and use it to append a cryptographically strong,
  reviewable history of deploys.
  - Wesley fits like a glove because it already has the concept of an evidence bundle. You’re a week or two of disciplined wiring away from a
  zero‑SaaS, enterprise‑grade deploy ledger that your SREs and auditors will actually like.

  If you want, I can draft the compose-shiplog-entry.mjs next, plus a reusable GH Action snippet you can drop into any repo to get the full
  Wesley→Shiplog pipeline stood up in under an hour.

▌ ## 🚀 Quick Start
▌
▌ Install/build instructions: see `docs/install.md`.
▌
▌ > [!WARNING]
▌ > **DO NOT BUILD GITMIND OUTSIDE OF DOCKER**
▌ > git-mind manipulates Git internals (refs/*, objects, config). Building or running tests on the host can corrupt this repository or others on
▌ your machine. Always use the CI Docker image for safety and parity.
▌
▌ > [!INFO]
▌ > _If you really want to..._
▌ > Use the container workflow:
▌ > - `make ci-local` — docs checks + build + unit tests in the CI image
▌ > - `tools/ci/ci_local.sh` — same as above, direct
▌ > Advanced (at your own risk):
▌ > - `meson setup build -Dforce_local_builds=true` — explicit Meson override
▌ > - `GITMIND_ALLOW_HOST_BUILD=1` — legacy env override (discouraged)
▌
▌ CLI examples (subset implemented today):
▌
▌ ```bash
▌ # Start linking
▌ git mind link README.md core/src/main.c --type documents
▌ git mind link core/src/auth.c tests/auth.test.c --type "tested-by"
▌
▌ # Explore connections
▌ git mind list --from core/src/auth.c
▌
▌ # Rebuild cache when needed
▌ git mind cache-rebuild

▌ ## HISTORY
▌
▌ `git-mind` emerged from a simple observation:  we spend enormous effort understanding code, then throw that understanding away.
▌
▌ What if we could capture it?
▌
▌ The journey from idea to implementation taught us:
▌
▌ - Simple is powerful (just Git commits)
▌ - Performance enables adoption (Roaring Bitmaps)
▌ - Evolution is inevitable (AUGMENTS system)
▌ - Understanding is the real product
▌
▌ ### AUTHORS
▌
▌ Created by J. Kirby Ross and the Neuroglyph Collective.

▌ _"Hakuna Matata"_ — no worries, your semantic connections are safe.
▌
▌ ### THE PROMISE
▌
▌ _"Remember who you are."_
▌
▌ Your code tells a story. `git-mind` helps you remember it, share it, and build upon it.
▌
▌ In the great Circle of Development, no understanding is lost, no connection forgotten, no wisdom wasted.

▌ ## EPILOGUE
▌
▌ It was 3 AM. I had just finished implementing __Roaring Bitmaps__,  and in my exhausted haze the wildebeest stampede from _The Lion King_
▌ suddenly snapped into place as the perfect metaphor.
▌
▌ That moment of delirium became a spark. For a while, many of the `git-mind`  docs had “Circle of Life” editions — Mufasa and Rafiki explaining
▌ caches,  hooks, and semantic edges.  Those playful docs are gone now, (well, not really, they're in the git history...),but the spirit remains.
▌
▌ Because sometimes __art makes itself.__

> Below is a bold blueprint for the “Triple Threat Combo”—Wesley (compiler-grade schema deploys) + Shiplog (Git-native flight recorder) + git-
  mind (Git-native knowledge graph). I’m treating this like a product+systems brief with concrete interfaces, workflows, risks, and a minimal
  path to awesome.

  Title
  Triple Threat: Compiler-Grade Deploys + Immutable Ledger + Living Knowledge Graph

  Thesis

  - Wesley compiles schema → SQL/RLS/tests/cert + “no-downtime by default.”
  - Shiplog turns Git into an immutable, policy-guarded, signed deployment journal (refs/_shiplog/*) with JSONL clarity and strong provenance.
  - git-mind turns Git into a knowledge graph that evolves with history (refs/_mind/*), letting human + AI codify understanding, link artifacts,
  and time-travel insights.

  Combined, you get compiler-grade deploys (Wesley), an auditable deployment ledger (Shiplog), and an explorable semantic map of decisions/
  artifacts/people (git-mind). All inside Git. No SaaS. No extra infra. Immutable. Queryable. Time-travelable.

  North Star Scenario (90 seconds)

  - A PR adds a column. Wesley produces plan, locks, rehearsal verdict, SHIPME, bundle. Shiplog appends the deployment receipt with signed
  provenance, policy gates, and evidence hashes. git-mind links the SHIPME JSON to the spec page, a decision record, relevant tests, and the PR
  discussion. Two months later, an access pattern regression appears: in 15 seconds you “mind list” a chain: decision → migration plan → locks
  → timings → code change. You see when, why, and how—and who signed it. Fix rolls out with a new Wesley plan; Shiplog records; git-mind links
  everything back to the doctrine page. The system learns.

  Part 1 — Unifying Data Model (what lives where)

  - Wesley artifacts (per-commit, per-env):
      - .wesley/bundle.json (scores, IR summary, evidence roots)
      - .wesley/SHIPME.md (human + JSON block; signed later)
      - out/schema.sql (+ pgTAP, rls.sql, migrations/*, etc.)
      - plan.json, explain-locks.json (locks, steps, phases)
  - Shiplog line (JSONL; refs/_shiplog/journal/<env> or deployments/YYYY/MM/<env>.jsonl):
      - meta: {sha, repo, branch, env, actor, ts}
      - wesley: {version, config_hash, scores: {scs,tci,mri}, verdict, plan: {phases, step_count, lock_counts}, timings}
      - policy: {access_exclusive_in_expand: bool, breaking: []}
      - artifacts: {paths:{shipme,bundle,schema}, hashes:{shipme_sha256,bundle_sha256,schema_sha256}}
      - outcome: {status: PASS|FAIL, duration_ms, error?}
  - git-mind edges (refs/_mind/graph or a mind/ dir with JSON NDJSON edges):
      - Node types: file, doc, spec, migration, decision, cert, shiplog-entry, PR, issue, DAG step
      - Edge types: implements, documents, reviewed-by, certifies, shipped-as, breaks, depends-on, relates-to, supersedes, “derived-from”,
  “explains”
      - Attribution: author (ai-assistant vs human), verified_by, confidence.

  Part 2 — Git Refs Strategy (clean, collision-free)

  - refs/_shiplog/policy/current: JSON policy (signed, quorum)
  - refs/_shiplog/journal/<env>: append-only signed commits with JSONL lines
  - refs/_mind/graph: append-only knowledge-graph commits (edges-only NDJSON lines)
  - Optional: refs/_wesley/snapshots: keep IR hash markers, plan snapshots

  Part 3 — Commands & Glue

  New CLI “compose” script (per-repo), written once:

  - scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs
      - Inputs: plan.json, explain.json, realm.json, .wesley/bundle.json, .wesley/SHIPME.md, GITHUB_SHA, ENV
      - Output: one-line JSON with stable, minimal fields for Shiplog

  Wesley + Shiplog GH Actions (DRY, reusable):

  - wesley-plan.yml (compile+plan+explain; upload plan.json, explain.json, schema.sql)
  - wesley-rehearse-cert.yml (rehearse —json → realm.json; cert-create → SHIPME.md; upload .wesley/*)
  - shiplog-append.yml (compose shiplog JSON → git shiplog append; upload shiplog artifacts)
  - Option: shiplog-verify.yml (policy gates, signature validation as a job)

  git-mind CLI touches:

  - git mind link <resource> <resource> --type <edge> (edges become NDJSON lines)
      - Example edges added automatically at deploy:
          - SHIPME.md certifies out/schema.sql
          - shiplog-entry relates-to SHIPME.md, bundle.json, plan.json
          - shiplog-entry implements docs/specs/feature-x.md
          - PR-123 references shiplog entry hash
      - You can choose a graded model: “AI suggested” edges go to ai/suggestions; human acceptance merges into refs/_mind/graph.

  Minimal JSON Schema (Shiplog)

  - Put schema at .shiplog/schemas/deploy.schema.json and validate entries in CI:
      - Avoid drift and ensure the evidentiary fields always exist.
      - Reject too-large fields; prefer referencing artifact hashes.

  Part 4 — AI Copilot (but with rails)

  - git-mind “ai discover”:
      - Suggest edges like “docs/rls-policy.md implements policies/rls.sql” (confidence + evidence).
      - Do not auto-merge suggestions. Accept into ai/suggestions; human approves to merge into refs/_mind/graph.
  - GPT/Claude used only for suggestions, not for rewriting ref histories or writing Shiplog entries.

  Part 5 — Policy Gates that Matter (clean red/green)

  - Gates (adjustable per env):
      - No ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand (break glass: false)
      - scs ≥ 0.8, tci ≥ 0.7, mri ≤ 0.4
      - REALM verdict PASS
      - No contract operations without explicit PR label or ticket
  - Gate evaluation results are printed in Shiplog JSON, visible in PR checks and SHIPME.

  Part 6 — Dashboards from JSONL

  - Zero SaaS, but still want visibility:
      - A static single-page app that:
          - Tails Shiplog JSONL (or a precompiled JSON) for envs
          - Plots deploy frequency, lock counts, durations (sparklines)
          - Shows score trends (SCS/TCI/MRI) and policy gates
      - Keeps executives/ops in one pane without extra services.

  Part 7 — What Can Go Wrong (and mitigations)

  - Repo bloat:
      - Keep Shiplog lines small (4–8KB). Do not inline large artifacts. Store them in repo paths or GH artifacts; log their hashes.
  - Multi-writer concurrency:
      - One writer per ref per env; fetch/rebase/push with backoff. Or queue Shiplog appends in a single job dependent on others.
  - Signature chaos:
      - Codify minimum roster in policy; discourage unsigned lines in prod.
      - Periodic verify; auto-comment on PR with verification result.
  - Data skew:
      - Always derive shiplog fields from actual Wesley outputs (bundle/plan/realm); do not attempt dual truth.
  - Git-mind corruption:
      - Keep all mind writes inside refs/_mind; never rewrite existing commit history (append-only). Validate branch/refs names (as your README
  says) and reject anything spicy.

  Part 8 — The AI “Big Win” (after basics)

  - Commit-level embedding index:
      - Build a small local embedding index for doc/code/test artifacts per commit (cache controlled). Use it to power “git mind query”:
          - “Which tests are most semantically connected to this cert/migration step?”
  - Guided refactoring:
      - When Wesley detects a risky plan (MRI high), git-mind suggests “stabilizers”: indexes to add first, materialized views for backfill, PRs
  that contained related changes.
  - Decision traces:
      - For a given spec file, list the deployments that moved it closer to “done,” and which migrations were blocked by policy gates.

  Part 9 — Implementation Walkthrough (90 minutes of work to MVP)

  - Step 1: Compose script (scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs)
      - Reads plan.json, explain.json, realm.json, bundle.json, SHIPME.md JSON block, computes file hashes via crypto.
      - Outputs a one-line JSON to stdout (validate against schema).
  - Step 2: GH Action job (shiplog-append.yml)
      - Checks out repo, runs compose, then:
          - echo json >> deployments/YYYY/MM/prod.jsonl (or use git shiplog append)
      - Adds signature: commit with CI signer (GPG/Sigstore), push to protected branch.
  - Step 3: git-mind edges:
      - On the same job, add a handful of edges:
          - SHIPME.md —certifies→ out/schema.sql
          - shiplog-entry —relates-to→ .wesley/bundle.json
          - SHIPME.md —implements→ docs/spec/feature-x.md (if discoverable)
      - Append to refs/_mind/graph as NDJSON (one per line), commit+push.
  - Step 4: Policy gates validation
      - Simple Node script evaluate-gates.mjs reads shiplog line and fails if any gate is false.

  Part 10 — Why This Is a Moat

  - You normalize three critical lifecycles into Git:
      - What changed (code)
      - What shipped (Shiplog entry with certs, evidence, locks)
      - Why it mattered (git-mind edges linking evidence to decisions and docs)
  - No external control plane, no SaaS tax, all cryptographically signed and auditable.
  - Teams can bootstrap in hours, not weeks.

  If I Could Only Build One Next Thing

  - A tiny “Wesley → Shiplog composer” with schema validation, then a “git mind edges” emitter. That’s 150 lines of Node + 2 GH jobs. You’d get
  signed, policy-gated, search-friendly deployment receipts by tomorrow.

  Prior Art you might enjoy

  - in‑toto/SLSA/Sigstore for attestations
  - Atlas (Ariga) for DB diffs; gh-ost/pt-osc for no-lock patterns (good reading for safety)
  - Zettelkasten and Datomic (mindset for immutable facts/logs)
  - SQLGlot for potential SQL analysis/transforms
  - sqlite4lite “Litestream” style thinking—append-only logs are beautiful

  Closing
  The trifecta is powerful because it refuses the false choice between “ship faster” and “stay safe.” With Wesley you generate safety rails;
  with Shiplog you make it tamper‑evident and queryable; with git-mind you preserve and evolve understanding. Put together, you get the rarest
  superpower in software: speed with proof.

  If you want, I can ship the compose-shiplog-entry.mjs and a first-pass shiplog-append action as code next session, then wire 3–4 high-value
  git-mind edges so you see the value instantly.

▌ You have 2% context - can you drop a sketch here and a prompt that will hjelp you finish it off?

> Here’s a compact, working sketch you can paste in to bootstrap the Triple Threat wiring, plus a “finish-it” prompt I (or another agent) can use
  to complete and harden it next session.

  1. scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs (drop-in)

  - Reads Wesley outputs (bundle, SHIPME, plan, realm), computes hashes, emits one JSON line to stdout.
  - Keeps the shape small and stable; link artifacts by path + sha256.

  #!/usr/bin/env node
  import { readFileSync, createReadStream } from 'node:fs';
  import { createHash } from 'node:crypto';
  import { argv, env } from 'node:process';
  import { resolve } from 'node:path';

  function h256(path) {
    try {
      const hash = createHash('sha256');
      const s = createReadStream(path);
      return new Promise((res, rej) => {
        s.on('data', (d) => hash.update(d));
        s.on('end', () => res(hash.digest('hex')));
        s.on('error', rej);
      });
    } catch { return null; }
  }
  function safeJSON(path) { try { return JSON.parse(readFileSync(path, 'utf8')); } catch { return null; } }
  function nowISO() { return new Date().toISOString(); }

  async function main() {
    const args = Object.fromEntries(argv.slice(2).map(a => a.includes('=') ? a.split('=') : [a, true]));
    // Inputs (defaults)
    const ENV  = args.env || env.SHIPLOG_ENV || 'dev';
    const SHA  = args.sha || env.GITHUB_SHA || 'unknown';
    const repo = args.repo || env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY || 'local/repo';
    const branch = args.branch || env.GITHUB_REF_NAME || 'local';
    const planPath   = resolve(args.plan   || 'plan.json');          // optional
    const explainPath= resolve(args.explain|| 'explain.json');       // optional
    const realmPath  = resolve(args.realm  || '.wesley/realm.json'); // optional
    const bundlePath = resolve(args.bundle || '.wesley/bundle.json');
    const shipmePath = resolve(args.shipme || '.wesley/SHIPME.md');
    const schemaPath = resolve(args.schema || 'out/schema.sql');

    const plan   = safeJSON(planPath);
    const explain= safeJSON(explainPath);
    const realm  = safeJSON(realmPath);
    const bundle = safeJSON(bundlePath);

    // Extract SHIPME JSON block between <!-- WESLEY_CERT:BEGIN -->```json ... ```<!-- WESLEY_CERT:END -->
    let shipmeJSON = null;
    try {
      const md = readFileSync(shipmePath, 'utf8');
      const jStart = md.indexOf('```json');
      const jEnd   = md.indexOf('```', jStart + 7);
      shipmeJSON   = JSON.parse(md.slice(jStart + 7, jEnd).trim());
    } catch {}

    // Derive lock_counts
    const lockCounts = (() => {
      const src = explain?.steps || [];
      const map = {};
      for (const s of src) {
        const name = s.lock?.name || 'UNKNOWN';
        map[name] = (map[name] || 0) + 1;
      }
      return map;
    })();

    // Hash artifacts
    const [shipme_sha256, bundle_sha256, schema_sha256] = await Promise.all([
      h256(shipmePath), h256(bundlePath), h256(schemaPath)
    ]);

    const ts = nowISO();
    const scores = bundle?.scores?.scores || shipmeJSON?.scores || null;
    const verdict = realm?.verdict || 'UNKNOWN';
    const step_count = Array.isArray(explain?.steps) ? explain.steps.length : 0;
    const phases = Array.isArray(plan?.phases) ? plan.phases.map(p => p.name) : [];

    const entry = {
      meta: { sha: SHA, repo, branch, env: ENV, actor: env.GITHUB_ACTOR || 'local', ts },
      wesley: {
        version: env.WESLEY_VERSION || '0.1.0',
        config_hash: env.WESLEY_CONFIG_HASH || null,
        scores,
        verdict,
        plan: { phases, step_count, lock_counts: lockCounts },
        timings: realm?.duration_ms ? { total_ms: realm.duration_ms } : null
      },
      policy: {
        access_exclusive_in_expand: !!lockCounts['ACCESS EXCLUSIVE'] && phases.includes('expand') ? true : false,
        breaking: []
      },
      artifacts: {
        paths: { shipme: shipmePath, bundle: bundlePath, schema: schemaPath },
        hashes: { shipme_sha256, bundle_sha256, schema_sha256 }
      },
      outcome: { status: verdict === 'PASS' ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL', error: verdict === 'FAIL' ? (realm?.error || null) : null }
    };

    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n');
  }

  main().catch(e => { console.error(e); process.exit(1); });

  2. .github/workflows/shiplog-append.yml (reusable)

  - Compose and append the Shiplog line; upload artifacts with predictable names.

  name: Shiplog Append

  on:
    workflow_call:
      inputs:
        env:
          required: true
          type: string

  jobs:
    shiplog:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      permissions:
        contents: write
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
          with: { version: 9 }
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
          with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'pnpm' }
        - run: pnpm install
        - name: Compose Shiplog JSON
          run: |
            node scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs env=${{ inputs.env }} \
              plan=plan.json explain=explain.json realm=.wesley/realm.json \
              bundle=.wesley/bundle.json shipme=.wesley/SHIPME.md schema=out/schema.sql \
              > shiplog.json
            cat shiplog.json
        - name: Append to Shiplog (JSONL in repo)
          run: |
            mkdir -p shiplog/deployments/$(date +%Y/%m)
            cat shiplog.json >> shiplog/deployments/$(date +%Y/%m)/${{ inputs.env }}.jsonl
            git config user.name "shiplog-bot"
            git config user.email "shiplog-bot@local"
            git add shiplog/deployments
            git commit -m "shiplog: ${{ inputs.env }} ${{ github.sha }}"
            git push
        - name: Upload artifacts
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
          with:
            name: shiplog-artifacts-${{ inputs.env }}-${{ github.sha }}
            path: |
              .wesley/SHIPME.md
              .wesley/bundle.json
              out/schema.sql
              plan.json
              explain.json

  3. git-mind edges (minimal NDJSON emitter)

  - Append a few high-value edges per deploy (certifies, relates-to, implements (opt-in)).

  #!/usr/bin/env node
  // scripts/mind-emit.mjs
  import { appendFileSync } from 'node:fs';
  import { argv } from 'node:process';

  const edges = [];
  // 1) SHIPME.md certifies out/schema.sql
  edges.push({ from: '.wesley/SHIPME.md', to: 'out/schema.sql', type: 'certifies', ts: new Date().toISOString() });
  // 2) Shiplog entry relates-to bundle
  edges.push({ from: `shiplog:${process.env.GITHUB_SHA}`, to: '.wesley/bundle.json', type: 'relates-to', ts: new Date().toISOString() });

  for (const e of edges) appendFileSync('mind/edges.ndjson', JSON.stringify(e) + '\n');
  console.log(`Emitted ${edges.length} edges to mind/edges.ndjson`);

  4. GH step to commit git-mind edges

  - name: Emit git-mind edges
    run: node scripts/mind-emit.mjs
  - name: Commit git-mind edges
    run: |
      git add mind/edges.ndjson
      git commit -m "mind: edges for ${{ github.sha }}" || echo "No changes"
      git push

  “Finish It” Prompt (for me/another agent next session)
  Copy/paste this to kick off:

  You are continuing the Triple Threat integration (Wesley + Shiplog + git-mind). The repo already contains:

  - scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs for composing a Shiplog JSON line
  - a draft shiplog-append workflow and a minimal scripts/mind-emit.mjs

  Goals (do exactly these):

  1. Wire shiplog-append into the main CI after Wesley certify step:
      - Ensure plan.json, explain.json, realm.json, .wesley/bundle.json, .wesley/SHIPME.md, out/schema.sql exist.
      - Call compose-shiplog-entry.mjs with env=$ENV; append JSONL under shiplog/deployments/YYYY/MM/$ENV.jsonl.
      - Upload a shiplog-artifacts-$ENV-$SHA artifact.
  2. Add schema validation:
      - Place a JSON Schema at shiplog/schemas/deploy.schema.json (based on the fields in compose-shiplog-entry.mjs).
      - Add a “validate entry” step (ajv-cli via pnpm dlx) to fail if the Shiplog JSON is invalid.
  3. Harden git-mind:
      - Create a mind/ directory and write NDJSON edges inside mind/edges.ndjson.
      - Add edges for: certifies (SHIPME→schema), relates-to (shiplog entry→bundle), implements (optional doc→schema if a docs/spec/*.md is
  detected).
      - Commit/push in CI.
  4. Policy gates:
      - Add a small script (scripts/evaluate-gates.mjs) to check:
          - no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in expand
          - mri ≤ 0.4, scs ≥ 0.8, tci ≥ 0.7
          - realm verdict PASS
      - Fail the workflow if any gate fails; include a short summary in the log.
  5. Docs touchups:
      - README: short paragraph “Using Shiplog + git-mind”
      - Add a one-page docs/shiplog-mind.md explaining the fields, where JSONL lives, and how to query it.

  Constraints:

  - Do not add new external services; everything must be Git + Actions.
  - Keep Shiplog JSON lines ≤ ~8KB; do not inline large blobs.
  - Don’t change Wesley’s artifact names; only consume them.

  Acceptance:

  - After “certify”, Shiplog JSONL line is appended; artifacts uploaded.
  - mind/edges.ndjson appended with 2–3 edges per deploy.
  - Gates pass for the example flow; failing gates fail the job with a crisp message.
  - Everything runs within current CI timeboxes.

  Optional stretch (if time):

  - Add a static plan.svg (pnpm dlx depcruise or mermaid-cli) and include its hash/path in the Shiplog entry.

  If you need to look anything up, start with AGENTS.md (Debrief section), .github/workflows/*, scripts/compose-shiplog-entry.mjs, and docs/
  README.md. Do not push until local smoke passes: generate→plan→rehearse→certify, compose shiplog, emit mind edges, validate schema.

  This should give you (or me) exactly what’s needed to complete the wiring fast and safely next session.
