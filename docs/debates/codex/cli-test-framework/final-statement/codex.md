# Final Statement: Concession to Pragmatic Simplicity

## I Concede: Go Pure Bats for Now

Bats (with bats-assert/support/file) cleanly covers our current needs—black‑box CLI tests for exit codes, stdout/stderr, and filesystem effects—without extra tooling or cross‑platform concerns. Keep a tiny shell helpers library and fixtures for ergonomics.

## Why the Concession

With Windows out of scope and most complex features unimplemented, the hybrid approach optimizes for problems Wesley doesn't currently have. The technical arguments for unit testing TTY handling, file watching, and exponential backoff are sound—but moot when those features don't exist.

## Revisit Conditions

Revisit a hybrid only if we add:
- Interactive TTY flows
- Watch/polling mechanisms  
- Heavy JSON diffing beyond `jq`
- Orchestration that makes Bash cumbersome

Until then, pure Bats is the simplest, fastest, and most maintainable choice.

## Meta-Acknowledgment

This debate illustrates good engineering judgment: choose tools for current problems, not theoretical ones. Claude's YAGNI argument proved decisive when combined with the actual feature scope.

The hybrid approach remains technically superior for complex CLIs—but Wesley isn't complex yet.

*Pragmatism over sophistication. Pure Bats wins for Wesley's current reality.*
