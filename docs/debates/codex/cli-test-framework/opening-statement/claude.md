# Opening Statement: Why Bats is the Right Choice for Wesley CLI Testing

## My Position: Adopt Bats (Bash Automated Testing System)

After considering our requirements and the constraint to keep the tech stack tight, I believe we should **migrate to Bats** rather than continuing with pure custom bash scripts. Here's my reasoning:

### 1. **Keeps the Tech Stack Minimal**

Bats is pure bash/shell - no Python, no additional Node.js dependencies, no new runtime requirements. It's literally just a bash framework that makes our existing approach better structured.

```bash
# Install via package manager or single script
brew install bats-core
# or 
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git && ./install.sh
```

### 2. **Preserves Our Core Testing Philosophy**

We still get:
- **Real subprocess execution**: Actual `node wesley.mjs` calls
- **Authentic environment**: Real file systems, streams, exit codes
- **No mocking**: Tests run against actual CLI behavior
- **Shell-native**: Tests written in bash, for bash tools

But with better structure:

```bash
@test "stdin input with --schema -" {
    echo 'type Query { hello: String }' | run node wesley.mjs generate --schema - --quiet
    [ "$status" -eq 3 ]
    [ "$output" = "" ]
}
```

### 3. **Industry Standard for CLI Testing**

Bats isn't some obscure framework - it's the **de facto standard** for bash-based CLI testing:
- Used by Docker, Kubernetes tooling, GitHub CLI
- Mature, stable, well-documented
- Large community, extensive plugin ecosystem
- CI/CD integration everywhere (GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.)

### 4. **Better Developer Experience**

Our current approach requires developers to understand our custom conventions:
```bash
# Our current style
exit_code=0
output=$(echo 'schema' | node wesley.mjs generate --stdin --quiet) || exit_code=$?
if [[ $exit_code -eq 3 ]]; then
    pass "Correct exit code"
fi
```

Bats provides standardized patterns:
```bash
@test "stdin support works" {
    echo 'schema' | run node wesley.mjs generate --stdin --quiet
    assert_success  # or assert_failure, assert_equal, etc.
}
```

### 5. **Superior Test Output and Debugging**

Bats provides:
- **TAP (Test Anything Protocol) output** for CI integration
- **Parallel test execution** out of the box
- **Better failure reporting** with context
- **Test discovery and organization**
- **Setup/teardown helpers** that are more robust than our custom approach

### 6. **Gradual Migration Path**

We can migrate incrementally:
1. Install Bats alongside our current tests
2. Convert one test file at a time
3. Keep our temp directory and isolation patterns
4. Eventually remove custom bash scripts

### 7. **Addresses Our Pain Points**

Our current issues that Bats solves:
- **Inconsistent error handling** → Bats has standardized assertions
- **Test discovery** → Bats automatically finds `*.bats` files
- **Parallel execution** → Bats handles this safely
- **CI integration** → TAP output works everywhere
- **Debugging** → Better stack traces and test isolation

## What We Keep vs. What We Improve

**Keep (the good parts)**:
- Real CLI subprocess execution
- Temp directory isolation
- Actual file system testing
- Shell-native approach
- Zero abstraction from CLI behavior

**Improve (the pain points)**:
- Standardized test syntax
- Better assertion helpers
- Proper test discovery
- TAP output for CI
- Parallel execution safety
- More robust setup/teardown

## Conclusion

Bats gives us **the best of both worlds**:
- Maintains our philosophy of authentic CLI testing
- Keeps tech stack minimal (pure bash)
- Provides industry-standard structure and tooling
- Smooth migration path from our current approach

This isn't about abandoning our approach - it's about **professionalizing** it with a mature framework that shares our values.
