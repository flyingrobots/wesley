13 = count(‚úÖ completed), 60 = count(‚úÖ + - [ ])
```

## Executive Summary

**Overall Drift Score: 31/100 (CRITICAL)**

Wesley exhibits **CRITICAL drift** between its documented aspirations and actual implementation. While the vision and architecture documentation is comprehensive and well-designed, the reality shows major gaps in core functionality, missing platform adapters, and broken build systems.

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### üö® 1. Major Documentation Mismatch (Score: 0/100)

**CLAUDE.md vs Reality:**
- **Documented as**: D.A.T.A. (Database Automation, Testing, and Alignment) CLI tool for Supabase/PostgreSQL
- **Actually is**: Wesley - GraphQL schema-first code generator
- **Impact**: Completely wrong project description in primary configuration file

**Details:**
- CLAUDE.md describes Commander.js CLI with database migration commands
- Actual code uses basic argument parsing with GraphQL generation commands  
- References to `data` command everywhere, but binary is `wesley`
- Migration workflow documented but not implemented

### üö® 2. Missing Platform Adapter Implementation (Score: 15/100)

**Host-Node Package Issues:**
- **Expected**: Complete set of platform adapters as documented
- **Found**: Only 7 adapter files, missing critical implementations
- **Missing**: Index file exports, proper generator exports
- **Impact**: CLI imports fail, making entire system non-functional

**Critical Missing Exports:**
```javascript
// CLI expects these from @wesley/host-node but they don't exist:
import {
  GraphQLSchemaParser,      // ‚ùå Missing export
  PostgreSQLGenerator,      // ‚ùå Missing export  
  PgTAPTestGenerator,       // ‚ùå Missing export
  MigrationDiffEngine,      // ‚ùå Missing export
  WesleyFileWriter          // ‚úÖ Exists but not exported
} from '@wesley/host-node';
```

### üö® 3. Build System Completely Broken (Score: 0/100)

**Monorepo Issues:**
- CLI package expects `@wesley/host-node` but dependency isn't properly linked
- pnpm workspace configuration missing proper exports
- No build step to link packages before usage
- Command `pnpm exec wesley` fails with "Command not found"

### üö® 4. Architecture Pattern Mismatch (Score: 40/100)

**Hexagonal Architecture Claims vs Reality:**

**Documented Layers:**
```
Core (Domain) ‚Üí Ports (Interfaces) ‚Üí Adapters (Platform)
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```
Core (Mixed concerns) ‚Üí Host-Node (Incomplete adapters) ‚Üí CLI (Direct imports)
```

**Issues:**
- Core package has dependencies (GraphQL, Supabase libraries) - violates pure domain rule
- Ports exist but aren't consistently used
- Adapters incomplete and not properly abstracted

## Detailed Findings by Category

- ‚úÖ Event system partially implemented
- ‚úÖ Command pattern implemented
- [ ] Use cases layer incomplete
- [ ] Complex generators (TypeScript, Zod) missing implementations

**Host-Node Package (20% complete):**

- [ ] Generator adapters not exported
- [ ] Event bus implementation incomplete

**CLI Package (30% complete):**
- ‚úÖ Basic command structure exists
- ‚úÖ Generate command partially implemented
- [ ] Watch command not implemented
- [ ] Test runner not implemented  
- [ ] Import dependencies fail

### Package Architecture: 45/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Monorepo Structure:**
- ‚úÖ Logical package separation
- ‚úÖ Workspace configuration exists
- [ ] Package dependencies don't resolve
- [ ] Export maps incomplete
- [ ] Missing templates package entirely

### Test Coverage: 15/100 ‚ùå

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test file structure exists
- ‚úÖ Multiple testing strategies documented
- [ ] Tests likely don't run due to import failures
- [ ] No CI/CD validation of package linking
- [ ] Integration tests can't work without working CLI

### Example/Demo Quality: 60/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Example Schema:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive GraphQL schema with Wesley directives
- ‚úÖ Shows proper usage patterns
- [ ] Example doesn't run due to broken CLI
- [ ] No working demo to validate claims

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Package Export/Import Mismatch
The core problem is that the CLI expects fully functional exports from `@wesley/host-node`, but:
- [ ] 1. Host-node has no main index export file
- [ ] 2. Adapters exist but aren't exported
- [ ] 3. Generators are defined in core but expected from host-node

### Secondary Issue: Documentation-Implementation Gap  
Documentation was written for an aspirational architecture, but implementation hasn't caught up:
- [ ] 1. CLAUDE.md describes wrong project entirely
- [ ] 2. Architecture promises aren't fulfilled in code
- [ ] 3. Feature completeness claims don't match reality

### Tertiary Issue: Build System Not Production-Ready
The monorepo setup assumes all packages work together, but:
- [ ] 1. Workspace linking incomplete
- [ ] 2. No build step to verify package integration
- [ ] 3. CLI binary not properly built/linked

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Sprint 1)
- [ ] 1. **Fix CLAUDE.md**: Update to reflect Wesley, not D.A.T.A.
- [ ] 2. **Create host-node index.mjs**: Export all adapters properly
- [ ] 3. **Fix CLI imports**: Either move generators to host-node or fix import paths
- [ ] 4. **Add build step**: Ensure packages link before distribution

### Short-term (Sprint 2-3)  
- [ ] 1. **Complete missing adapters**: GraphQLSchemaParser, MigrationDiffEngine
- [ ] 2. **Implement CLI commands**: watch, test, investigate
- [ ] 3. **Fix CI pipeline**: Ensure generate:example command works
- [ ] 4. **Add integration tests**: Test full CLI workflow

### Medium-term (Sprint 4-6)
- [ ] 1. **Align architecture**: Make code match hexagonal promises
- [ ] 2. **Complete generator implementations**: TypeScript, Zod, etc.
- [ ] 3. **Add missing features**: Migration system, RLS generation
- [ ] 4. **Production hardening**: Error handling, edge cases

### Long-term (Sprint 7+)
- [ ] 1. **Multi-platform support**: Browser, Deno adapters
- [ ] 2. **Visual tooling**: Schema editor, debugging tools
- [ ] 3. **Framework integrations**: Next.js, Remix plugins
- [ ] 4. **AI features**: Schema optimization suggestions

## Success Metrics

To improve from **31/100 (CRITICAL)** to **90/100 (EXCELLENT)**:

- [ ] 1. **Package Linking (0 ‚Üí 95)**: All imports resolve, CLI runs
- [ ] 2. **Documentation Accuracy (40 ‚Üí 95)**: CLAUDE.md reflects reality
- [ ] 3. **Feature Completeness (25 ‚Üí 85)**: Core generators implemented
- [ ] 4. **Architecture Alignment (40 ‚Üí 90)**: Code matches documented patterns
- [ ] 5. **Build Quality (0 ‚Üí 85)**: CI passes, examples work

## Conclusion

Wesley has an **excellent architectural vision** but **critical implementation gaps**. The project shows sophisticated understanding of modern software architecture patterns, but the reality is a partially-implemented prototype with broken package management.

**The good news**: The foundation is solid and the vision is clear. With focused engineering effort on package exports and core generator completion, Wesley could quickly move from CRITICAL to MEDIUM drift levels.

**The challenge**: Bringing implementation up to the ambitious standards set by the documentation will require significant development work, particularly in the adapter layer and CLI integration.

*This analysis represents the state as of the current codebase. Regular drift analysis should be performed as development progresses.*
