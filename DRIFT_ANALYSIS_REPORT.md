# Wesley Implementation Status Report
*Updated after discovering Wesley pivoted from D.A.T.A. project*

## PROGRESS

```bash
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 35% ~= 21/60

21 = count(âœ… completed + - [x]), 60 = total tasks
```

## Executive Summary

**Overall Implementation Score: 35/100 (FOUNDATION PHASE)**

Wesley is a **Data Layer Compiler** that generates PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Zod, pgTAP tests, and Supabase integrations from GraphQL schemas. This project **pivoted from D.A.T.A.** (a database migration tool), which explains the apparent "drift" - it wasn't drift, it was a fundamental product change.

**Current Status:** Foundation exists, CLI runs, architecture is sound. Core compilation logic needs implementation.

## âœ… Resolved Issues (Previously Critical)

### ~~1. Major Documentation Mismatch~~ **FIXED**
- **Root Cause**: Wesley pivoted from D.A.T.A. project
- **Resolution**: Updated CLAUDE.md and removed all D.A.T.A. references
- **Status**: âœ… Documentation now correctly describes Wesley as Data Layer Compiler

### ~~2. Missing Platform Adapter Implementation~~ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: CLI couldn't import from @wesley/host-node
- **Resolution**: Created index.mjs with proper exports
- **Status**: âœ… CLI now runs successfully

### ~~3. Build System Completely Broken~~ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Package linking and exports were broken
- **Resolution**: Fixed exports, added pnpm-lock.yaml
- **Status**: âœ… Can run `node packages/wesley-cli/wesley.mjs`

## ðŸš§ Current Implementation Gaps

### 1. Generator Implementation (Score: 30/100)

**What Works:**
- âœ… PostgreSQLGenerator class exists
- âœ… PgTAPTestGenerator class exists
- âœ… Basic SQL generation structure

**What's Stubbed:**
- [ ] GraphQLSchemaParser - stub implementation
- [ ] MigrationDiffEngine - stub implementation  
- [ ] TypeScript generator - partial implementation
- [ ] Zod generator - not implemented
- [ ] RLS policy generator - not implemented

### 2. Architecture Alignment (Score: 60/100)

**What's Good:**
- âœ… Hexagonal architecture structure in place
- âœ… Clear separation of packages (core/host-node/cli)
- âœ… Ports and adapters pattern established

**Issues:**
- [ ] Core has some platform dependencies (should be pure)
- [ ] Not all operations go through ports
- [ ] Some adapters bypass abstraction layers

## Detailed Implementation Status

### Core Package (45% complete)
- âœ… Domain models (Schema, Table, Field) implemented
- âœ… Event system partially implemented
- âœ… Command pattern implemented
- âœ… PostgreSQL generator (basic)
- âœ… PgTAP generator (basic)
- [ ] TypeScript generator incomplete
- [ ] Zod generator missing
- [ ] Migration differ missing
- [ ] Use cases layer incomplete

### Host-Node Package (40% complete)
- âœ… File system adapter implemented
- âœ… Console logger implemented
- âœ… Index.mjs exports created
- âœ… Event bus implementation
- [ ] GraphQL parser needs real implementation
- [ ] pg-parser integration broken (library doesn't export expected functions)
- [ ] Migration engine not implemented

### CLI Package (50% complete)
- âœ… Basic command structure exists
- âœ… Generate command partially implemented
- âœ… CLI runs and shows help
- [ ] Watch command not implemented
- [ ] Test runner not implemented  
- [ ] Deploy command not implemented

### Holmes/Watson/Moriarty Packages (10% complete)
- âœ… Package structure exists
- [ ] Investigation logic not implemented
- [ ] Verification logic not implemented
- [ ] Prediction engine not implemented

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Early Stage Implementation
Wesley is in early development after pivoting from D.A.T.A. The architecture and vision are solid, but most generators and features need to be built.

### Secondary Issue: Stub Implementations
Many components have stub implementations to make the CLI run. These need to be replaced with real logic.

### Not Issues Anymore:
- âœ… Documentation mismatch (fixed - was due to pivot)
- âœ… Package exports (fixed)
- âœ… CLI execution (fixed)

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Current Sprint)
- [x] 1. **Fix CLAUDE.md**: Update to reflect Wesley, not D.A.T.A.
- [x] 2. **Create host-node index.mjs**: Export all adapters properly
- [x] 3. **Fix CLI imports**: Either move generators to host-node or fix import paths
- [x] 4. **Remove D.A.T.A. references**: Clean up old project references
- [ ] 5. **Implement GraphQLSchemaParser**: Replace stub with real parser

### Short-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
- [ ] 1. **Complete PostgreSQL generator**: Full DDL generation with all directives
- [ ] 2. **Implement TypeScript generator**: Generate types from GraphQL
- [ ] 3. **Implement Zod generator**: Runtime validation schemas
- [ ] 4. **Add watch mode**: File watching with incremental compilation

### Medium-term (Sprint 4-6)
- [ ] 1. **Migration system**: Diff and plan generation
- [ ] 2. **RLS generation**: Supabase Row Level Security policies
- [ ] 3. **pgTAP test generation**: Comprehensive test suites
- [ ] 4. **Production hardening**: Error handling, edge cases

### Long-term (Sprint 7+)
- [ ] 1. **Holmes/Watson/Moriarty**: Investigation and prediction systems
- [ ] 2. **Multi-platform support**: Browser, Deno adapters
- [ ] 3. **Visual tooling**: Schema editor, debugging tools
- [ ] 4. **Deployment integration**: Direct deploy to Supabase

## Success Metrics

To reach **90/100 (PRODUCTION READY)**:

- [x] 1. **Package Linking (0 â†’ 100)**: âœ… All imports resolve, CLI runs
- [x] 2. **Documentation Accuracy (0 â†’ 100)**: âœ… Docs reflect Wesley reality
- [ ] 3. **Generator Completeness (30 â†’ 90)**: Implement all generators
- [ ] 4. **Architecture Alignment (60 â†’ 90)**: Pure core, proper ports
- [ ] 5. **Test Coverage (15 â†’ 80)**: Comprehensive test suites

## Conclusion

Wesley is not "broken" or suffering from drift - it's a **new project that pivoted from D.A.T.A.** The foundation is solid:
- âœ… Clear vision as Data Layer Compiler
- âœ… Good architectural design
- âœ… CLI runs after our fixes
- âœ… Documentation now accurate

**Next Priority:** Replace stub implementations with real generator logic, starting with GraphQL parsing and PostgreSQL generation.

The project is in much better shape than the original "drift" analysis suggested. It just needs its core compilation features to be implemented.
