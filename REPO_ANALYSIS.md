## Executive Summary
- **Project Type:** Node.js/TypeScript Monorepo (CLI Tool & Libraries)
- **Organization Score:** 8/10
- **Critical Issues:** 0
- **Quick Wins:** 2

This repository is well-organized and follows modern best practices for a `pnpm` monorepo. It has excellent documentation, CI/CD, and code quality tooling in place. The main area for improvement is tidying the root directory to make it easier for new contributors to navigate.

## Current Structure Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well
- **Monorepo:** Correct use of `pnpm` workspaces to manage multiple packages.
- **Standard Files:** Presence of `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **CI/CD:** Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows are set up in `.github/workflows`.
- **Code Quality:** `eslint`, `prettier`, and `.editorconfig` are consistently used.
- **Testing:** A root `test/` directory for E2E tests and clear package-level test setups.
- **Documentation:** A `docs/` directory with what appears to be a documentation site setup.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **Cluttered Root Directory:** Several non-essential or project-meta markdown files are located in the root directory. This increases noise and can make it harder to find key files.
- **Redundant Files:** There appear to be two `schema.graphql` files at the root level (`schema.graphql` and `graphql/schema.graphql`), which could cause confusion.

## Priority-Based Recommendations

### üí° Priority 3: Enhancement (Quick Wins)

These are non-critical changes that will improve the overall organization and navigation of the repository.

1.  **De-clutter the Root Directory**
    - **Issue:** The root directory contains several documents that are not essential for a developer's first-glance understanding of the project.
    - **Recommendation:** Move these meta-documents into a new `docs/project` directory. This keeps the root clean and focused on core development files.
    - **Files to Move:**
        - `AGENTS.md`
        - `CODEX.md`
        - `DRIFT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
        - `go-public-checklist.md`
        - `ROLLBACK.md`
        - `architecture.svg` (to `docs/architecture/`)

2.  **Consolidate GraphQL Schemas**
    - **Issue:** The presence of both `schema.graphql` and `graphql/schema.graphql` is confusing.
    - **Recommendation:** Identify the single source of truth and remove the redundant file. If both are needed, document their distinct purposes in the `graphql/README.md`.

## Implementation Guide

I have generated a `reorganize.sh` script to perform the file moves. You should review the script and then execute it.

For the GraphQL schema consolidation, you will need to manually determine which file to keep. For example, if `graphql/schema.graphql` is the correct one, you would run:

```bash
git rm schema.graphql
```
