# Agents Activity Log

## 2025-09-29

- Resolved the README merge conflict on `pr-16`, restoring the generate → rehearse → deploy workflow while keeping the new messaging.
- Deleted the stale `.git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp` swap file so the merge could proceed cleanly.
- Pr-16 is ready for a merge-commit (`git commit`) followed by `git push origin pr-16`.
