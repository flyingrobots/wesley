# Agents Guide and Policy

This document defines repo‑wide conventions and guardrails for human and AI agents contributing to this project. It applies to the entire repository unless a nested `AGENTS.md` overrides a section. Project owner directions and the conventions in `docs/` take precedence if conflicts arise.

## Scope and Precedence
- Read `docs/` (especially docs/README.md, milestones, and architecture) before changing code or workflows.
- If a directory contains its own `AGENTS.md`, that file’s guidance applies to that subtree.

## Intent and Guardrails
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes that directly address the task. Do not “clean up” unrelated code.
- Do not move/rename files, rewrite workflows, or add dependencies unless strictly required to solve the current issue.
- Preserve CLI voice and demo narrative (BLADE/HOLMES) in user‑facing output.

## CI/CD Philosophy
- Keep “main CI” deterministic and fast. It should run the core project tests and gates; long e2e/bats belong in dedicated workflows.
- The dedicated CLI workflows (e.g., `cli-tests.yml`, `cli-quick.yml`) own CLI end‑to‑end/bats checks. Avoid duplicating them in main CI without approval.
- When failures arise, fix tests/product logic rather than muting or skipping steps. If you must mute, document why and the revert plan.

## Test Policy
- Keep existing test topology: unit, integration, property, snapshots, e2e. Add new tests in the matching suite only.
- Do not weaken assertions just to pass CI unless the behavior is intentionally changed and documented in the PR.
- Snapshot updates require justification in the commit message.

## Workflow Changes
- Only touch `.github/workflows/*` when:
  1) Fixing a deterministic break (syntax/path/quoting), or
  2) Reducing obviously wasteful runtime or duplication;
  and provide a revert path in the PR description.
- Use least privilege; do not widen permissions or add secrets without approval.

## Package Scripts
- Do not convert tests into global “skip” behaviors in `package.json`. Skips should be explicit in workflows or temporary, with a follow‑up issue to restore coverage.

## Branching and PRs
- Branch names: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*` with short, descriptive kebab‑case.
- One‑topic PRs with a tight diff. CI should pass unless the PR specifically repairs CI.
- PR description must include context, rationale, alternatives considered, risks, and backout.

## Commit Hygiene
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `fix(core): …`, `test(cli): …`, `ci: …`).
- Group related changes; avoid mixing refactors with behavior changes.

## Code Style and APIs
- Follow existing module layout and boundaries; keep public APIs stable. Document migration notes if an API change is intentional.

## Local Verification
- Run the smallest relevant subset first (single package or suite) before the workspace tests. Prefer reproducible commands in your PR notes.

## Runtime/Secrets/DSNs
- Never log secrets or real DSNs in CI or code. Sample DSNs must be clearly fake and documented as such.

## Agent Behavior
- Before edits: state intent and list files you expect to touch.
- After edits: summarize the delta and CI effects (which jobs pass/fail and why).

### 2025-09-29
- Resolved the README merge conflict on `pr-16`, restoring the generate → rehearse → deploy workflow while keeping the new messaging.
- Deleted the stale `.git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp` swap file so the merge could proceed cleanly.
- `pr-16` marked merge‑ready.

### 2025-10-02 — SITREP (PR #18) + Session Debrief

SITREP
- PR: `feat(cli+ci): enforce boundaries, adapterize CLI, canonicalize docs; minimal RLS emission` (#18)
- Branch: `fix/cli-adapters-and-boundaries`
- Summary of changes (tight, scoped commits):
  - CI (architecture-boundaries):
    - Enforce node:* ban in core via dependency-cruiser + ESLint.
    - Use Node 20; install pnpm first; call `pnpm dlx depcruise`.
    - Replace `rg` with portable `grep`; print offending files on failure.
  - CI (main):
    - Keep tests and postgres service.
    - Removed `validate-bundle` + HOLMES gating for now (evidence bundle not guaranteed).
  - CI (cert-shipme):
    - Fixed docker options (no line continuation escapes).
    - Align flags: `--out-dir` for transform/plan; workflow now green.
  - Host adapters: added `ctx.shell.exec/execSync`; extended `NodeFileSystem` with `join/resolve`; expose `globalThis.wesleyCtx` in host entry.
  - CLI: refactored `rehearse`, `up`, `plan`, `generate`, `cert-*`, `validate-bundle` to use injected adapters (`ctx.fs`, `ctx.shell`); registered `validate-bundle` in `program.mjs`.
  - Core purity: removed `node:buffer`; added pure `util/EventEmitter.mjs` and `util/hash.mjs`; updated imports accordingly.
  - Generator: minimal RLS emission from `@wes_rls` (enables RLS + policy statements when expressions present).
  - Docs: added `docs/plan-for-alignment.md` (checklists) + `docs/guides/quick-start.md`; canonicalized README and examples to `@wes_*`.

CI state (latest runs at 2025-10-02)
- Passing: CLI E2E (Ubuntu Node 18/20/22), Quick CLI Test, SHIPME Certificate job, Main CI build-test.
- Failing: Architecture Boundary Enforcement — the “Validate import statements” shell step flags a core import violation, but no offending files print after the latest grep hardening (node:buffer already removed). Likely a false positive from earlier patterning; next run should print actual matches if present.

Notes on scope/guardrails
- Stayed within minimal change set; avoided widening permissions or secrets.
- Preserved CLI voice; added guidance in docs rather than altering user‑facing narratives.

Debrief — What worked / decisions
- Adapterization is effective: CLI no longer imports Node APIs directly; platform concerns live in `@wesley/host-node`.
- Purity gates are in CI now (dep-cruise + ESLint). We favored explicit guards over brittle ad‑hoc greps; greps are retained as lightweight smoke checks.
- Minimal RLS: intentionally limited to explicit expressions; tenant/owner defaults are planned (tracked below).
- Main CI gating on HOLMES/evidence was removed to stabilize the pipeline; will be reintroduced once generation consistently emits bundles in CI.

Hand‑off — Next steps for the next agent
1) Unblock the boundaries job (highest priority)
   - Investigate the failing “Validate import statements” step in `.github/workflows/architecture-boundaries.yml`.
   - If it continues to fail without printing matches, flip that step to verbose mode:
     - Add `set -euo pipefail` and `set -x` at the start of the step.
     - Echo variables `FS_MATCHES`, `PATH_MATCHES`, `NODE_MATCHES`.
   - Optional: remove the fs/path `grep` checks entirely and rely only on ESLint + dependency-cruiser (already enforced and more reliable). Keep the node:* grep (portable) if you want a quick guard.
   - Confirm no `node:*`, `fs`, or `path` imports exist under `packages/wesley-core/src` (current grep shows none; `node:buffer` is already removed).

2) Reinstate bundle validation and HOLMES gates (once bundles are stable)
   - Modify main CI to call `generate` with `--emit-bundle` and pass the correct `--bundle` path into `validate-bundle`.
   - Re‑enable HOLMES investigate/verify/predict on the emitted `.wesley` artifacts; gate on scores if desired.

3) RLS generator (Phase 2)
   - Add defaults: generate tenant/owner policies when `@wes_tenant(by: ...)` or `@owner(column: ...)` is present and `@wes_rls` omits an expression.
   - Add a tiny pgTAP suite for RLS policies (enable/USING evaluation smoke) to run under CI postgres.

4) Plan phases (MVP+)
   - Implement `backfill/switch/contract` phases (additive‑only in MVP), wire to `plan` explain output and to `rehearse` SQL emission.
   - Keep destructive diffs in explain‑only mode for MVP.

5) Documentation alignment
   - Fix broken links in `docs/README.md` (Guides and Internals pages that don’t exist).
   - Sweep `docs/features/row-level-security.md` and other guides to use canonical `@wes_*` consistently.
   - Keep Quick Start as the canonical entry; ensure README points to it.

6) Adapterization sweep (finish)
   - Double‑check remaining CLI commands/utilities for any lingering Node API imports; centralize process/TTY concerns in `program.mjs` only.

Operational guidance for the next agent
- Keep changes surgical and commit‑scoped: one concern per commit (ci:, fix(cli):, refactor(core):, docs:).
- When touching workflows:
  - Prefer portable shell (bash + grep), avoid non‑standard tools unless installed.
  - Don’t widen permissions or add secrets.
- When touching core:
  - No `node:*` imports; if needed, add a pure util under `packages/wesley-core/src/util`.
  - Keep ESLint `no-restricted-imports` intact; run the ESLint core task locally before pushing.
- Local repro tips:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `node packages/wesley-host-node/bin/wesley.mjs generate --schema example/schema.graphql --allow-dirty`
  - For RLS: `--supabase` to emit `out/rls.sql` where `@wes_rls` exists.
  - Run core ESLint purity locally: `pnpm exec eslint --no-eslintrc -c packages/wesley-core/.eslintrc.cjs "packages/wesley-core/src/**/*.mjs"`.

Open questions / Decisions to confirm
- Do we keep manual grep checks for fs/path/node:* now that dep-cruise + ESLint enforce purity, or rely solely on the tools?
- When to re‑enable evidence + HOLMES gating in main CI (target after RLS defaults + evidence stabilization)?

### 2025-10-02 — Session Debrief (Local Discipline + Next Moves)

Why this entry
- We saw repeated CI cycles while iterating on the architecture‑boundaries job. To conserve CI minutes and keep feedback snappy, we’re adopting a strict local pre‑push discipline that mirrors CI.

New local pre‑push checklist (run before any push)
- Install (non‑frozen to avoid lockfile mismatches):
  - `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
- Full workspace tests:
  - `pnpm -w test`
- Architecture boundaries (depcruise smoke):
  - `pnpm dlx depcruise --config .dependency-cruiser.mjs packages/`
- Core purity (ESLint) — use an ESLint that supports .eslintrc.cjs:
  - Option A (preferred, local only): `pnpm dlx eslint@8.57.0 --no-eslintrc -c packages/wesley-core/.eslintrc.cjs "packages/wesley-core/src/**/*.mjs" --max-warnings=0`
  - Option B (if we lift to flat config later): use repo ESLint as configured by CI
- CLI smoke:
  - `node packages/wesley-host-node/bin/wesley.mjs generate --schema example/schema.graphql --allow-dirty`

Rules of engagement
- Do not push if any of the above fail locally. Fix locally first, then push a single tight commit.
- Group related changes; keep commits surgical (ci:, fix(cli):, refactor(core):, docs:).

Immediate next moves (to be done locally first)
1) Boundaries job
   - Current PR has simplified checks (depcruise + ESLint + lightweight node:* and host import smoke). Run the local pre‑push set; if clean, push a single commit to re‑run CI. If ESLint v9 conflicts locally, use the v8 dlx command above.
2) Reinstate bundle validation + HOLMES (after emit‑bundle stabilization)
   - Switch CI generate to `--emit-bundle`, then add `wesley validate-bundle` with the correct bundle path, re‑enable HOLMES steps and score gating.
3) RLS defaults + tests
   - Extend generator to default tenant/owner USING expressions if `@wes_tenant`/`@owner` present and `@wes_rls` omits an expression; add a minimal pgTAP suite in CI postgres.
4) Plan phases (MVP+)
   - Implement `backfill/switch/contract` phase emission, wire to `plan --explain` and `rehearse` SQL emission; keep destructive changes explain‑only for MVP.
5) Docs
   - Fix broken links in `docs/README.md`; sweep `docs/features/row-level-security.md` for canonical `@wes_*` usage.

Hand‑off instructions for the next agent
- Context: PR #18 on branch `fix/cli-adapters-and-boundaries` is almost green; only the architecture‑boundaries job is pending stabilization.
- Start by running the local pre‑push checklist exactly as above.
- If depcruise/ESLint pass locally but CI still fails the boundaries job:
  - Temporarily add `set -euo pipefail` and `set -x` plus explicit `echo` of matches to the boundaries job to surface the exact offender, then remove the verbosity once green.
  - Prefer tool‑based enforcement (depcruise + ESLint) over brittle greps; keep only the simple node:* + host‑import smoke checks.
- Once boundaries is green:
  - Add `--emit-bundle` in CI generate; reintroduce `validate-bundle` and HOLMES gating (investigate/verify/predict) using the emitted `.wesley` bundle.
  - Proceed to RLS defaults + pgTAP, then plan phases, in that order, with one scoped PR if this PR is merged, or follow‑up commits if requested.
- Commit hygiene: keep changes minimal and separated; include rationale in each commit message.
