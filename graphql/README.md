# GraphQL Reference Schema

The `graphql/` directory holds the canonical sample schema used throughout examples and tests.

- `schema.graphql` â€“ A comprehensive SDL that exercises Wesley directives and serves as the default input for quick-start commands.

Use it as a reference when authoring your own schemas or when extending directive support. For runnable fixtures, see the curated examples under `test/fixtures/examples/`.
